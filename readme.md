#Firebase Authentication model with NodeJS

##Intro to Auth

* In last few days, I realized that there is not enough source that shows the implementation of express-structured web application using nodeJS. This project shows all the possibilities about Firebase Authentication could do with Express like framework instead of the examples from Google, which is DOM manipulated application and hard to read it all at once.

* What kind of stacks is being used?
    * NodeJS
    * EJS
    * Express
    * Firebase Authentication

* According to the official suggestions from the Firebase Documentation, all the methods are based on its documentation about Authentication instructions from the Google Firebase.
